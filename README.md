This is my personal repository to save my thesis script.

This thesis is about video transcoding from OLD format to AV1 format.

As OLD, you can understand as VP9, VP8, H264, and H265 (for now).

An expansion of https://github.com/amborges/ViTech_Gerenciador repository was done.

In MAKEFILE file was explained how this script works, but summary:

$make prepara  OLD_DECODER="OLD"
$make all OLD_DECODER="OLD"
